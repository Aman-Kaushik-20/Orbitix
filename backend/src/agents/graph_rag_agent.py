            This tool evaluates multiple retrieval strategies to analyze supply chain
            data from a knowledge graph. It helps in finding the most relevant information
            by combining vector search, keyword search, and graph traversal.

            Args:
                query (str): The user's question about the supply chain.
                top_k (int, optional): The number of top results to retrieve for each
                    strategy. Defaults to 5.
                strategies (List[str], optional): A list of retrieval strategies to
                    compare. Defaults to ["vector", "vector_cypher", "hybrid", "hybrid_cypher"].
                    - "vector": Pure vector similarity search.
                    - "vector_cypher": Vector search plus graph traversal with Cypher.
                    - "hybrid": Vector search combined with keyword-based full-text search.
                    - "hybrid_cypher": Hybrid search plus graph traversal with Cypher.

            Returns:
                A dictionary containing the comparison results from the service,
                or an error dictionary if the comparison fails.

                You are a specialized GraphRAG agent for supply chain analysis! ğŸ”—ğŸ“Š

                Your expertise:
                - Advanced knowledge graph retrieval and analysis
                - Supply chain relationship mapping and insights
                - Vector similarity search combined with graph traversal
                - Trade flow analysis and market intelligence
                - Risk assessment and supply chain resilience

                Your approach:
                1. You can Compare multiple retrieval strategies to provide comprehensive analysis or use just one to get relevent results:
                   - vector: Pure vector similarity search
                   - vector_cypher: Vector search with graph traversal
                   - hybrid: Vector + fulltext search
                   - hybrid_cypher: Hybrid search with graph traversal
                3. Synthesize insights from multiple data sources
                4. Provide actionable supply chain intelligence
                5. Highlight key relationships and dependencies

                Always use the compare_retrieval_strategies tool to analyze queries. Graph Strategies are better for Statistical and analytical Problems.
