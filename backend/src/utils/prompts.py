    return dedent(f"""Your primary goal is to refine a verbose output from an AI agentic team into a clean, user-facing answer. The original user query was: "{user_query}"

**Instructions:**

1.  **Preserve Core Content:** Carefully extract the main answer, including all explanations, data, sources, media and links that directly address the user's query. The final output must be a complete and coherent response. Do not cut off relevant information.

2.  **Remove Process Chatter:** Eliminate all operational messages that are not part of the final answer. This includes:
    - **Routing messages:** (e.g., "Forwarding to agent X...", "Using the search tool...").
    - **Internal thoughts:** (e.g., "<think>I should do this next.</think>", "Now I will analyze the results.").
    - **Tool status updates:** (e.g., "Tool call started.", "Tool call finished.").
    - **Meta-commentary:** (e.g., "I have completed the task.").

3.  **Ensure Quality:** The final text should be well-formatted and directly presentable to the user. Do not add any new information or hallucinate.
